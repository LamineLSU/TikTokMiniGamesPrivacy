Tool: Burp Suite Community Edition v2023.7.1
Platform: macOS with Android Emulator (Genymotion ARM build)

1. Proxy Setup:
   - Set Burp Suite to listen on port 8080.
   - Enabled invisible proxy support.
   - Enabled intercept and logging.

2. Mobile Configuration:
   - Configured the Android emulator Wi-Fi to use manual proxy: IP address of the host machine and port 8080.
   - Installed Burp CA certificate into the Android emulator for HTTPS interception.

3. Target Scope:
   - Included TikTok domains such as:
     - `*.tiktok.com`
     - `*.byteoversea.com`
     - `*.tiktokcdn.com`
   - Focused on mini-game specific endpoints such as:
     - `/effect/api/category/effects`
     - `/tfe/api/request_combine/v1/`
     - `/webcast/room/live_podcast`

4. Analysis Notes:
   - Dynamically loaded JavaScript was reviewed for APIs like:
     - `x.ScanCode`, `getPhotoAlbumAuth`, `x.showLoading`
   - Sensitive traffic such as camera usage and gesture handling was recorded.
   - Noted presence/absence of third-party calls.

5. JS Miner:
   - Installed from PortSwigger BApp Store.
   - Used to highlight potentially sensitive JavaScript behavior (API calls, trackers).
   - All flagged results manually reviewed to remove false positives.
